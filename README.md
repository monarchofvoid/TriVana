## 🌌 Overview
*TriVana* is a web-based platform designed to *accelerate exoplanet discovery* using *advanced machine learning* and *immersive 3D simulations. Leveraging **CNNs, Random Forest classifiers, and clustering algorithms*, the platform enables users—from casual enthusiasts to professional researchers—to analyze astrophysical datasets, predict exoplanet existence accurately, and explore orbital systems interactively in real time.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- *Dual Modes of Use*
  - *Demo Mode:* Quick Kepler ID predictions with instant 3D orbital simulation.  
  - *Explore Mode:* Advanced research tools, including CSV uploads, light curve generation, classification, graph plotting, and detailed feature visualization.
- *Hybrid Machine Learning:* Combines CNN, Random Forest, and clustering for precise exoplanet detection.  
- *Data Flexibility:* Supports NASA catalogue queries and custom user uploads.  
- *Immersive Interface:* Dark-themed, responsive UI with animated starfield and interactive 2D/3D orbit visualizations using Three.js/WebGL.  
- *Real-time Feedback:* Instant results and visualizations with interactive planetary simulations.
